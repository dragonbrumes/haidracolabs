          <h1 className="western">1. What information we collect</h1>
          <p>
            We only need to collect minimal information for advertising
            purposes. We collect the following types of data:
          </p>
          <h2 className="western">1.1 Anonymous Information</h2>
          <p>
            The anonymous information the Company collects (i.e. information
            that does not enable identification of individual persons) includes
            technical information transmitted by the end user’s device,
            including the end user’s software specifications (e.g. browser type
            and version, operating system, version).
          </p>
          <h2 className="western">1.2 Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            We only collect the Android Advertising Identifier, needed to
            display advertising by third parties. We do not collect any other
            personal information such as name, passwords.
          </p>
          <h2 className="western">1.2.1 Advertising Identifiers</h2>
          <p>
            When you are using our a mobile application that incorporates our
            Services, we may also automatically record your Android Advertising
            ID (if you are using an Android device) , for advertising or
            analytics purposes. The Google Advertising ID is an anonymous
            identifier, provided by Google Play services. If your device has an
            Advertising ID, we may collect and use it for advertising and user
            analytics purposes. If your device does not have Advertising ID, we
            may use other persistent identifiers. The information collected may
            be also stored on your device. Please see below how you can reset
            you mobile Advertising ID or opt-out of receiving targeted ads
            through your mobile Advertising IDs.
          </p>
          <h1 className="western">
            2. What is the Purpose of collecting the information?
          </h1>
          <p>We collect the information specified above in order to:</p>
          <p>
            &#8211; enable the Company to further provide, develop, enhance,
            customize and improve the Services, based on the end users&#8217;
            preferences, uses and interactions with the Services;
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8211; detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or
            technical issues;
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8211; to respond to claims that any content available through the
            Service violates rights of third-parties;
          </p>
          <p>
            To resolve disputes and enforce our policies, including
            investigation of potential violations thereof, for the purpose of
            law enforcement or in accordance with any applicable law or
            regulation.
          </p>
          <h1 className="western">3. Mobile Device Opt-Out</h1>
          <p>
            You may opt out of receiving targeted ads on mobile devices using
            the Android operating system, by using platform level controls
            enabled through your device settings. You should consult your device
            settings and instructions provided by your device manufacturer.
            However, we provide the following information solely for
            informational purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have an Apple device, you can opt out of targeted advertising
            by updating to iOS 6.0 or higher, and setting &#8220;Limit Ad
            Tracking&#8221; to &#8220;ON&#8221;. You can do this by clicking on
            Settings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Advertising, and toggling &#8220;Limit
            Ad Tracking&#8221; to &#8220;ON&#8221;. This prevents apps that you
            use from using your Apple device’s Advertising Identifier to serve
            you targeted ads. In addition, or as an alternative, you may reset
            your device’s Advertising Identifier, which will result in your
            device being disassociated from ad targeting profiles based on the
            Advertising Identifier in effect prior to reset. You can do this by
            clicking on Settings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Advertising -&gt; Reset
            Advertising Identifier. Again, you should consult Apple’s support
            web pages and instructions for the most current applicable settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have an Android device, you can opt out of targeted
            advertising on your device. You can do this by clicking the menu
            icon to display the apps list, then find and select the Google
            Settings icon, then find and select &#8220;Ads&#8221; and check the
            box &#8220;Opt out of interest-based ads&#8221;. In addition, or as
            an alternative, you may reset your device’s Android advertising ID,
            which will result in your device being disassociated from ad
            targeting profiles based on the Android advertising ID in effect
            prior to reset. You can do this by clicking the menu icon to display
            the apps list, then find and select the Google Settings icon, then
            find and select &#8220;Ads&#8221; and selecting &#8220;Reset
            advertising ID&#8221;. Note that Android settings menus may vary
            among device manufacturers and these instructions may not be
            accurate for your device. You should consult Google’s settings and
            instructions for the most current settings information.
          </p>
          <h1 className="western">4. With whom we share information</h1>
          <p>
            We do not share Personal Information with third parties except as
            specifically consented by the end user pursuant to this Privacy
            Policy (for advertising purposes) or if required by applicable laws
            or court order.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anonymous information may be shared with other third parties (ad
            networks, advertising companies, service providers, media) for the
            purpose of developing or delivering advertising.
          </p>
          <h1 className="western">5. Children&#8217;s information</h1>
          <p>
            The Services are not directed or intended for children under 13
            years of age. We do not knowingly collect or solicit information
            from individuals under 13 years of age. If we later obtain actual
            knowledge that an end user is under 13 years of age, we will take
            steps to remove that end user&#8217;s information from our systems.
          </p>
          <h1 className="western">6. Storing and retaining the information</h1>
          <p>
            We do not store the information collected on any of our servers but
            collect and deliver it to third parties only for advertising
            purposes.
          </p>
          <h1 className="western">7. Security and confidentiality</h1>
          <p>
            We use industry standard information security tools and measures, as
            well as internal procedures and strict guidelines to prevent
            information misuse and data leakage. Our team accesses the
            information on a &#8220;need-to-know&#8221; basis and subject to
            confidentiality obligations.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we strive to use commercially acceptable means and procedures
            to protect the information, which considerably reduce the risks of
            data misuse, we cannot guarantee that our systems will be absolutely
            safe. To notify the Company about any security vulnerability or
            potential data breach, please contact us at: contact@haidraco-labs.com,
            and we will take the appropriate measures to address such incident,
            as deemed necessary.
          </p>
          <h1 className="western">8. Merger, sale or bankruptcy</h1>
          <p>

            party entity, or other corporate transaction, or in the event of
            bankruptcy or a comparable event, we reserve the right to transfer
            or assign information in connection with the foregoing events. In
